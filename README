Ganeti NBMA tools
=================

Ganeti non-broadcast-multiple-access networking tools (nbma tools) allow a
Ganeti cluster to be built over a "foreign" network where bridging instances to
the node network and grabbing addresses in their IP space is not possible.

When using Ganeti in NBMA mode the instance network is totally virtualized.
Instances are created with routed NICs, and their traffic is routed over GRE
tunnels between node themselves for instance-to-instance communication, and to
special designed gateways for outside access.
